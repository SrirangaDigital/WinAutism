						<h1>AUTISM</h1>
						<hr />
					<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 2em;text-align: justify;">
						Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.
					</p>
					<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 2em;text-align: justify;">
						While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.

						<h1>KRISHNA NARAYANAN</h1>
						<hr />
					<p>
					When Krishna Narayanan was four years old, his mother showed him an apple and repeated, "Apple... apple..." He knew not only the word 'apple', but many, many other complicated words. He wanted to cry out to his mother that he knew all of them, but no words came out of his mouth; just a garbled sound.
					</p>

					<p>
					Inside an elevator as a four year old, Krishna felt extremely tense. To relieve the tension, he stretched out his right hand and watched his fingers. This was a weird mannerism to the onlookers, and many thought he was insane. The liftman ridiculed him with nasty jokes. It hurt Krishna, and he badly wanted to tell his mom that he felt ridiculed and hurt, but he lived in a silent world.
					</p>

					<p>Once on the school playground a kid came and asked, 'How are you?' Krishna answered in his mind, 'Fine, how are you?' But in reality, nothing came out of his mouth.

					<p>
					This is a poignant and powerful book written by an autistic who pours out in rapture and agony his 
					deep inner feelings about his abnormal and at once challenging life. His life was an unfathomable mystery
					and an unsolvable enigma to others because he had little speeching and no writing ability. When at the late
					age 23 he acquired the ability to write, it was an infinite thrill for him and the family. He started to write
					in order to educate his parents; now he hopes to enlighten other parents through this book. 
					</p>
					<p>					
						As he lived intensely this unique, uncommunicative and  unusual life, he starts with the question
					</p>
					<p>
					"Who was I to the world but, really, who was I?"
					</p>
					<p>
						He eloquently explores this theme in this whole book but more
						emphatic emphasis is given in the first chapter which concludes movingly as follows; 
						``To the world, I was weird and insane, given to funny movements with no speech. To me,
						I was normal in intelligence, feelings and emotions. But I was afflicted with a debilitating
						disease that robbed me of speech and coordination and endowed me with enormous tension and fear..." 
					</p>
					<p>
						This book deals with his tumultuous and scathing battle with autism and early therapy,
						his painful and lonely sojourn in a residential school, the beneficial and esoteric Ayurvedic
						treatment in India, the stunning breakthrough, his burning passion for education especially 
						higher education and other insightful penetrating episodes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This book will be immense value not only to parents, siblings and professionals in autism but also to the
						general public as a story of challenging endeavor and an unique touching human experience.

					The novel is set against the background of a modern, fast moving technology driven world and an ancient,

					The cross currents of the cultures, the conflicts  of personalities and the stress of modern life form the
					background of this novel. Classical, musical melody flows in and through this tender love stroy.

					<p>
					This book evolved from two books published recently.  
					The ﬁrst book <span class="italic bld">“From a Mother’s Heart; a Journal of  
					survival, challenge and hope”</span> written by my mother; 
					Jalaja Narayanan, is a snapshot of events in one year 
					of my life. The purpose of that book was to portray the 
					daily life with an autistic; the agony and the triumphs
					of everyday life are poignantly pointed out. However,
					the techniques used to overcome autism are scattered
					throughout the book. 
					</p>

					<p>
					My book, <span class="italic bld">“Wasted Talent; Musings of an Autistic”</span>, is 
					a biographical account stressing the feelings, emotions,
					frustrations and elation of being an autistic in this
					world. It is chronological in nature and the methods
					employed are also dispersed through out the book.
					</p>

					<p>
					Many parents requested a book that outlines the
					methods and therapies in a cogent and methodical
					manner: This book <span class="italic bld">“Quest; Search for a Quality Life ”</span> 
					is the answer to their sincere request. The title succinctly 
					summarizes the theme of the book. Utmost importance
					is enhancing the quality of the childs life. Everyday,
					one should ask “How can I improve my child today?”
					</p>

					<p>
					My own life would provide an incentive to young
					parents. At age four, I had little understanding of
					language and the world around me; in addition, I had
					poor eye-hand coordination, no speech and was beset
					with tension and fear: Today, I am writing my third book,
					a novel - which I hope to complete in six months. I love
					to go to music concerts and cinema theatres, eat out in
					good restaurants and attend marriage ceremonies. My 
					tension and fear are considerably reduced. Except for
					speech, I am almost normal, with writing as my
					profession.
					</p>


					<p>
					This book primarily focuses on techniques that have
					worked for me. It is not necessarily a comprehensive
					list of therapies.
					</p>

					<p>
					What are the key techniques?
					</p>

					<p>
					The ﬁrst chapter discusses the need to <span class="italic bld">“Dream a
					Quality life”</span> for the autistic child. The second chapter
					points out the important role of <span class="italic">“Intuition”.</span> The crucial
					importance of “Structure” is brought out in the third
					chapter. Next, how an enormous task can be tackled by
					breaking it into small steps is discussed.
					</p>

					<p>
					The headings of succeeding chapters, well illustrate
					the theme; <span class="italic bld">“Build on Strength”</span>,  
					<span class="italic bld">“Education - A Necessity”</span>, 
					<span class="italic bld">“Medications &amp; Alternative Treatments”</span>, 
					<span class="italic bld">“Behavior; Behavior, Behavior”</span> and 
					<span class="italic bld">“Learning Social Etiquette”</span>.
					</p>

					<p>
					Above all, the title <span class="italic">“Quest; Search for a Quality Life ”</span>,
					is the motto we have employed and are continuing to
					use.
					</p>

					<p>
					<span class="italic bld">“Arise, awake; stop not till the goal is reached.”</span>
					</p>

					<p>
					With best wishes.

					<p>
					Couple of decades ago, 
					a gripping question  plagued Krishna 
					 Narayanan, the author, ``why did God punish  me with autism, a  
					debilitating syndrome? ls He merciless and 
					cruel?" This query, “Why me?" was so poignant 
					and powerful that he started on an intense 
					inward journey to search for the answer .........
					Search it was ........... always relentless ............. at 
					times, painful ......... at times, emotional  at 
					times, very frustrating. But, he did not give up 
					the Quest ............... though slow at first in the 
					twilight of ignorance and darkness ............ but 
					steadily, this intense search took him to a very 
					different plane of thinking  deeply 
					logical and subtly intuitive .......... almost to the 
					threshold of the transcendental. 
					</p>
					<p>
					In this hook, Krishna Narayanan, shares with us 
					his precious inward journey and the 
					inspirational insights that he has gained along 
					the way. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Let us start this pensive, invigorating and 
					ahove all logical journey with him..........

						‘Why Me? ’ asks Krishna Narayanan, and embarks on An Inward Journey.
						His journey has been quite rewarding. Behind this autistic person is a
						serious, sincere seeker, wanting to unravel the mystery of life and the role
						of suffering in understanding it. This book has many insights and stirring
						expressions. But it is not just a layman’s understanding of Vedanta but a
						seeker’s attempt to write a handy volume of spiritual approach to life’s
						problems. Krishna analyses the idea of God, of Self, of ego, of various
						spiritual paths such as Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga, of ‘Me’ in time and
						space and much more. ‘Who prays?’ he quizzes. ‘I?’ Yes, but as one prays,
						he tells us, ego becomes a partner of God and slowly, as it prays, the ego
						melts away and God alone remains. The book abounds in such striking
						expressions. All those interested in understanding the Vedantic view  of
						life will benefit reading this book.
