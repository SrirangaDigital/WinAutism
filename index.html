						<h2>AUTISM</h2>
						<hr />
					<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 2em;text-align: justify;">
						Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.
					</p>
					<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 2em;text-align: justify;">
						While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.

						<h2>KRISHNA NARAYANAN</h2>
						<hr />
					<p>
					When Krishna Narayanan was four years old, his mother showed him an apple and repeated, "Apple... apple..." He knew not only the word 'apple', but many, many other complicated words. He wanted to cry out to his mother that he knew all of them, but no words came out of his mouth; just a garbled sound.
					</p>

					<p>
					Inside an elevator as a four year old, Krishna felt extremely tense. To relieve the tension, he stretched out his right hand and watched his fingers. This was a weird mannerism to the onlookers, and many thought he was insane. The liftman ridiculed him with nasty jokes. It hurt Krishna, and he badly wanted to tell his mom that he felt ridiculed and hurt, but he lived in a silent world.
					</p>

					<p>Once on the school playground a kid came and asked, 'How are you?' Krishna answered in his mind, 'Fine, how are you?' But in reality, nothing came out of his mouth.

					This is a poignant and powerful book written by an autistic who pours out in rapture and agony his 
					deep inner feelings about his abnormal and at once challenging life. His life was an unfathomable mystery
					and an unsolvable enigma to others because he had little speeching and no writing ability. When at the late
					age 23 he acquired the ability to write, it was an infinite thrill for him and the family. He started to write
					in order to educate his parents; now he hopes to enlighten other parents through this book. 
					</p>
					<p>					
						As he lived intensely this unique, uncommunicative and  unusual life, he starts with the question
					</p>
					<p>
					"Who was I to the world but, really, who was I?"
					</p>
					<p>
						He eloquently explores this theme in this whole book but more
						emphatic emphasis is given in the first chapter which concludes movingly as follows; 
						``To the world, I was weird and insane, given to funny movements with no speech. To me,
						I was normal in intelligence, feelings and emotions. But I was afflicted with a debilitating
						disease that robbed me of speech and coordination and endowed me with enormous tension and fear..." 
					</p>
					<p>
						This book deals with his tumultuous and scathing battle with autism and early therapy,
						his painful and lonely sojourn in a residential school, the beneficial and esoteric Ayurvedic
						treatment in India, the stunning breakthrough, his burning passion for education especially 
						higher education and other insightful penetrating episodes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This book will be immense value not only to parents, siblings and professionals in autism but also to the
						general public as a story of challenging endeavor and an unique touching human experience.

					This book evolved from two books published recently.  
					The ﬁrst book <span class="italic bld">“From a Mother’s Heart; a Journal of  
					survival, challenge and hope”</span> written by my mother; 
					Jalaja Narayanan, is a snapshot of events in one year 
					of my life. The purpose of that book was to portray the 
					daily life with an autistic; the agony and the triumphs
					of everyday life are poignantly pointed out. However,
					the techniques used to overcome autism are scattered
					throughout the book. 
					</p>

					<p>
					My book, <span class="italic bld">“Wasted Talent; Musings of an Autistic”</span>, is 
					a biographical account stressing the feelings, emotions,
					frustrations and elation of being an autistic in this
					world. It is chronological in nature and the methods
					employed are also dispersed through out the book.
					</p>

					<p>
					Many parents requested a book that outlines the
					methods and therapies in a cogent and methodical
					manner: This book <span class="italic bld">“Quest; Search for a Quality Life ”</span> 
					is the answer to their sincere request. The title succinctly 
					summarizes the theme of the book. Utmost importance
					is enhancing the quality of the childs life. Everyday,
					one should ask “How can I improve my child today?”
					</p>

					<p>
					My own life would provide an incentive to young
					parents. At age four, I had little understanding of
					language and the world around me; in addition, I had
					poor eye-hand coordination, no speech and was beset
					with tension and fear: Today, I am writing my third book,
					a novel - which I hope to complete in six months. I love
					to go to music concerts and cinema theatres, eat out in
					good restaurants and attend marriage ceremonies. My 
					tension and fear are considerably reduced. Except for
					speech, I am almost normal, with writing as my
					profession.
					</p>


					<p>
					This book primarily focuses on techniques that have
					worked for me. It is not necessarily a comprehensive
					list of therapies.
					</p>

					<p>
					What are the key techniques?
					</p>

					<p>
					The ﬁrst chapter discusses the need to <span class="italic bld">“Dream a
					Quality life”</span> for the autistic child. The second chapter
					points out the important role of <span class="italic">“Intuition”.</span> The crucial
					importance of “Structure” is brought out in the third
					chapter. Next, how an enormous task can be tackled by
					breaking it into small steps is discussed.
					</p>

					<p>
					The headings of succeeding chapters, well illustrate
					the theme; <span class="italic bld">“Build on Strength”</span>,  
					<span class="italic bld">“Education - A Necessity”</span>, 
					<span class="italic bld">“Medications &amp; Alternative Treatments”</span>, 
					<span class="italic bld">“Behavior; Behavior, Behavior”</span> and 
					<span class="italic bld">“Learning Social Etiquette”</span>.
					</p>

					<p>
					Above all, the title <span class="italic">“Quest; Search for a Quality Life ”</span>,
					is the motto we have employed and are continuing to
					use.
					</p>

					<p>
					<span class="italic bld">“Arise, awake; stop not till the goal is reached.”</span>
					</p>

					<p>
					With best wishes.

					Couple of decades ago, 
					a gripping question  plagued Krishna 
					 Narayanan, the author, ``why did God punish  me with autism, a  
					debilitating syndrome? ls He merciless and 
					cruel?" This query, “Why me?" was so poignant 
					and powerful that he started on an intense 
					inward journey to search for the answer .........
					Search it was ........... always relentless ............. at 
					times, painful ......... at times, emotional  at 
					times, very frustrating. But, he did not give up 
					the Quest ............... though slow at first in the 
					twilight of ignorance and darkness ............ but 
					steadily, this intense search took him to a very 
					different plane of thinking  deeply 
					logical and subtly intuitive .......... almost to the 
					threshold of the transcendental. 
					</p>
					<p>
					In this hook, Krishna Narayanan, shares with us 
					his precious inward journey and the 
					inspirational insights that he has gained along 
					the way. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Let us start this pensive, invigorating and 
					ahove all logical journey with him..........

						‘Why Me? ’ asks Krishna Narayanan, and embarks on An Inward Journey.
						His journey has been quite rewarding. Behind this autistic person is a
						serious, sincere seeker, wanting to unravel the mystery of life and the role
						of suffering in understanding it. This book has many insights and stirring
						expressions. But it is not just a layman’s understanding of Vedanta but a
						seeker’s attempt to write a handy volume of spiritual approach to life’s
						problems. Krishna analyses the idea of God, of Self, of ego, of various
						spiritual paths such as Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga, of ‘Me’ in time and
						space and much more. ‘Who prays?’ he quizzes. ‘I?’ Yes, but as one prays,
						he tells us, ego becomes a partner of God and slowly, as it prays, the ego
						melts away and God alone remains. The book abounds in such striking
						expressions. All those interested in understanding the Vedantic view  of
						life will benefit reading this book.

                            <h2>Krishna Narayanan</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/Krishna_Narayanan.png" class="img-responsive img-centered myimage" alt="">
							<p>
							When Krishna Narayanan was four years old, his mother showed him an apple and repeated, "Apple... apple..." He knew not only the word 'apple', but many, many other complicated words. He wanted to cry out to his mother that he knew all of them, but no words came out of his mouth; just a garbled sound.
							</p>

							<p>
							Inside an elevator as a four year old, Krishna felt extremely tense. To relieve the tension, he stretched out his right hand and watched his fingers. This was a weird mannerism to the onlookers, and many thought he was insane. The liftman ridiculed him with nasty jokes. It hurt Krishna, and he badly wanted to tell his mom that he felt ridiculed and hurt, but he lived in a silent world.
							</p>

							<p>Once on the school playground a kid came and asked, 'How are you?' Krishna answered in his mind, 'Fine, how are you?' But in reality, nothing came out of his mouth.
							</p>

							<p>
							He had to pass through 23 long years of mental torture, hurt, and agony, but his mother's relentless spirit in educating him and Ayurvedic treatment at the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala and at the K A Samajam Hospital at Shoranur helped Krishna write what went on within him.
							</p>

							<p>
							He wrote: 'Who was I to the world? But really, who was I? The world and the autistic are like the theatre audience and the actor. The world sees the autistic as weird and insane... Kindled by tension, fear and insecurity, the autistic behaves inappropriately. The weird behaviour of the autistic drives the world up the wall. The state of the autistic is a sad one.'
							</p>

							<p>
							BOSTON, December 1971. When Krishna was born, Jalaja Narayanan was in bliss. At that moment itself she had so many dreams for him. "I wanted him to be a great scientist. I wanted him to be a neurosurgeon. At times, I thought both."
							</p>

							<p>
							But soon the young mother found her dreams crumbling. Even as a one year old, her son didn't walk, didn't utter a word, didn't show any interest in toys, and didn't like to be held or cuddled. By two, he was displaying bizarre behaviour like looking at his hands, flapping them, rocking, hitting his head against the wall, tapping his chin, screaming, throwing tantrums and showing extreme fear in front of strangers. Krishna wanted to be far away from people all the time, in the isolation of his room; he even refused to come to the living room.
							</p>

							<p>
							"He was that withdrawn and lonely," remembers Jalaja. "I had another child Malini [now chief of neurosurgery at Harvard Medical Hospital in Boston] two years elder to him. So I knew there was something wrong with this child. But those were the Seventies, and there was nothing available on autism. The doctors didn't know how to diagnose autism, even in the US."
							</p>

							<p>
							So, when she took the year-and-a-half-old Krishna to the doctor, he was diagnosed to be deaf. The doctor also told her that Krishna would never be able to hear any sound. "That was the first diagnosis," says Jalaja, "but I didn't believe her because I had noticed him turning when the telephone rang, but not when we called him."
							</p>

							<p>
							At four, at the Children's Hospital in Boston, Krishna was diagnosed as severely autistic. The doctor also told her that he would never understand the human voice.
							</p>

							<p>
							Thus began the young mother's long drawn war on autism.
							</p>

							<p>
							"I was all alone with the diagnosis, and I didn't know what it was," she recounts. "When the doctors said my child would never understand human speech, I told them, no, I will make him understand. They asked, how? I said, I have 24 hours a day. They said, you cannot overbake a cake. I said, don't say that about my child, my child is a living being. He's not a cake."
							</p>

							<p>
							Krishna writes, 'Riding on my horse -- my young and innocent mom -- I fought a relentless, tireless, epochal war. The kid in me was handcuffed and life was hideous. I was a total prisoner of autism.'
							</p>

							<p>
							Krishna heard every word that was uttered; he also understood what was happening around him. 'To my parents, I was not dumb. In reality, I was never dumb. I knew the alphabet, I knew many words, and I knew how to fashion sentences. The tragedy of autism is being unable to communicate in words. An autistic's mind is normal, even brilliant, but complete absence of verbal expression makes his behaviour totally misunderstood. To the world, I was weird and insane, given to funny movements with no speech. To me, I was normal in intelligence, feelings and emotions, but afflicted with a debilitating disease that robbed me of speech and coordination, and endowed me with enormous tension and fear,' Krishna wrote at age 24.
							</p>

							<p>
							He describes his life as a human drama, a Greek tragedy that is seemingly sad and hopeless. He also likes to call his story a 'positive story of struggle, survival and success against all odds'.
							</p>

							<p>
							ON JUNE 24, P S Ramamohan Rao, governor of Tamil Nadu, inaugurated The Autism Centre started by Jalaja Narayanan in Chennai. The idea of starting such a centre came up when parents bombarded Jalaja for advice on how to bring up an autistic child. "I have been spending all my free time counselling parents, one at a time, which was taking a toll on me. So, I decided to start a centre from where I can counsel many parents because parents need motivation. This is not a one-day fight; it is a life-long war."
							</p>

							<p>
							She also has plans to start an Indian society for autism so that all parents of autistic children, all professionals working on autism, and all schools with autistic children are integrated.
							</p>

							<p>
							On the same day, the governor released a book jointly written by the mother and son, titled, Quest, Search for Quality Life. It comes after two books written separately by Jalaja and Krishna. Jalaja Narayanan wrote From A Mother's Heart; A journal of survival, challenge and hope in which she described her traumatic life bringing up an autistic child and also the various techniques used to overcome autism. The techniques are scattered through the book.
							</p>

							<p>
							Krishna's first book, Wasted Talent; Musings of an Autistic, was an account of how he got over all the hurdles to finally open his mind to his parents. Soon, he was writing his autobiography and learning complicated mathematics and physics.
							</p>

							<p>
							When many parents of autistic children constantly asked for advice on the various techniques and therapies used by them, the mother and son decided to write a book jointly.
							</p>

							<p>
							It starts with the chapter, 'Dream a Quality Life' for an autistic child. Krishna says the parents should ask every day, 'How can I improve my child today?'
							</p>

							<p>
							What helped Krishna come out of the tension-filled days in the early years of his life was music. His mother, a Carnatic singer herself, sensed her child's ear for music. With music in the background, Krishna who rocked and whined all night started sleeping soundly. Music also calmed him a lot more.
							</p>

							<p>
							The second chapter talks about the 'Power of Intuition'. Jalaja was so convinced that the child had the ability to understand and learn that she kept teaching him and reading out Charles Dickens, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Jane Austen, etc though there was absolutely no response from him. She continued to read out to him and make him listen to audio tapes of great world literature because she saw a 'sparkle' in his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
							Krishna wrote in his book, 'She felt sparkling eyes cannot come from a dull mind. This was a bold hypothesis when there was precious little output from me. In a similar vein, parents must probe and think where the strength of the child lies. Where does it show interest or aptitude? What activity calms him or what activity he does not mind doing? Earlier this talent is detected, larger will be the benefits.'
							</p>

							<p>
							Education is a necessity, Jalaja felt strongly, though to educate an autistic is extremely tough. Krishna admits, 'No challenge is greater than the challenge to educate the autistic because they are restless and their rigidity and rituals interfere with learning. They can neither write nor talk.'
							</p>

							<p>
							But what gave Krishna's life a breakthrough was ayurveda. 'We stumbled upon Ayurvedam and it totally turned my life around. Without it, I will not be where I am today. I cannot emphasize enough the wonderful role Ayurvedic treatment had in my life.'
							</p>

							<p>
							Once the treatment calmed his body and mind, his body became less rigid, fingers became supple, and he slowly started writing. By then, years had passed, and he was 23.
							</p>

							<p>
							His father, Dr S Narayanan, took a break from his job as director of Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, USA, and started teaching Krishna simultaneous equations in algebra. Krishna picked it up quickly. His father then taught him calculus, which also Krishna grasped rapidly. Dr Narayanan then moved to differential equations and Newtonian physics. Krishna loved quantum physics and relativity.
							</p>

							<p>
							'What did I get from education?' he wrote. 'Primarily, it provided me with self-confidence. Even though an autistic, I am as intelligent as the normal person, if not better, and can understand subtle and tough concepts in mathematics and physics.'
							</p>

							<p>
							As he acquired the ability to write, his parents asked him to tell them about himself so that they could know him. Words slowly came out onto paper, and there he was at the age of 23 telling his parents who he was, what he felt at age four, how he felt humiliated and ridiculed because the world looked at him as weird and insane when he had an intelligent mind. His mother was so impressed with his writing that she wanted him to write a book on himself.
							</p>

							<p>
							'This is more easily said than done; thus started an odyssey of six long years. Everyday, slowly, ever so slowly, I wrote a couple of paragraphs and the book began to take shape.'
							</p>

							<p>
							When Krishna titled the book Wasted Talent, his mother objected. 'The title reflects ultimately my belief that the talent of an autistic is wasted away if it is not nurtured.' An adamant Krishna refused to change the title.
							</p>

							<p>
							The book was published in July 2003, to rave reviews. Now, Krishna is in the process of writing a novel.
							</p>

							<p>He ends the book with, 'What is my future? I really don't know, but I can dream.' He dreams of learning more mathematics and teaching young students. 'That may happen because of the advances in the Internet. I could teach without speech.'</p>

							<p>He also dreams of the US Congress allocating enough funds to research both Eastern and Western treatments for autism. His third dream is that the world will not abandon him to an institution when his parents move on.</p>

							<p>His final dream is, 'An angel would descend from heaven to marry me and give me happiness and a family.'</p>

							<p>As he asks, what is life without dreams?</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
		                	<p><strong>Dearest Family and Friends:</strong><br />
							Krishna wrote in his first book, <em>Wasted Talent: Musings of an Autistic:</em><br />
							</p>
							<blockquote>
							The future is unknown; no one can predict it. So, what is my future? I really don’t know, but I can dream. Dreams make life worth living though the current reality  is stark and dreary. What are my dreams?  …. My fourth and final dream is that an angel would descend from heaven to marry me and give me happiness and a family!
							</blockquote>
							<p>
							We are happy to announce <em>that dreams do come true!</em> We want to celebrate with you the miracle of  Krishna and Priyanka’s first year anniversary.  They were married Nov 20<sup>th</sup> 2014 in a very small (adjusted for Krishna’s autism)  Hindu wedding.
							</p>
							<p>
							Priyanka and Krishna first met as neighbors in Chennai sixteen years ago and have been in touch ever since as friends.  Priyanka and Krishna share an enthusiasm for 3Es:  education,  economics and eating!  Priyanka studied at Lady Sivaswami Iyer Secondary  School, one of the top schools in Mylapore and passed  first class. She  then completed Bcom  and Mcom at Madras University.  Prior to marriage, Priyanka had worked in  Mudhre, an accounting firm, in Mylapore.   Her parents  live near Nagapattinum.
							</p>
							<p>  
							Krishna and Priyanka are forming a  loving bond and joy that only a husband and wife can share over the last year. Krishna and, for that matter, all of us,  knew it would take time for him to form this bond,  probably the ultimate challenge for an autistic.  He wanted to make his wedding announcement after he was comfortable in his marriage to Priyanka.  Priyanka understood his point of view, having known him for so many years. They enjoy watching old Tamil movies like Shivaji, Kamala Hasan,  going to the temple in the evening, listening to music, taking walks in the beach,  and reading books. 
							</p>
							<p>
							This announcement to all of our dear friends marks a tremendous milestone for Krishna and Priyanka and gives us great joy to share with all of you. We sincerely believe without God’s blessing and  the well wishes from all of you over many years,  this miracle <em><strong>from heaven</strong></em> could not have happened.  We thank all of you for being part of his and our life.  We continue to seek your blessing for Krishna and Priyanka.
